## Requirements

- [Deno](https://deno.land/) (latest version)
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) (version 8.x)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Install Deno

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex

# Linux/macOS
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
```

Verify installation:

```bash
deno --version
```

### 2. Install Deno Kernel

```bash
deno jupyter --unstable --install
```

### 3. VS Code Setup

Install the "Jupyter" extension for VS Code

- Open VS Code
- Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
- Search for "Jupyter"
- Install the official Jupyter extension by Microsoft

### 4. Clone and Setup Project

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/thangsnguyen07/deno-elasticsearch-notebooks.git
cd deno-elasticsearch-notebooks

# Install dependencies
deno cache main.ts
```

### 5. Start Local Elasticsearch

```bash
curl -fsSL https://elastic.co/start-local | sh
```

After running the command, you'll see output similar to this:

```
üéâ Congrats, Elasticsearch and Kibana are installed and running in Docker!

üåê Open your browser at http://localhost:5601

   Username: elastic
   Password: [your-password]

üîå Elasticsearch API endpoint: http://localhost:9200
üîë API key: [your-api-key]
```

Save the API key and password as they will be needed for authentication in the notebooks.

### 6. Configure Elasticsearch Connection

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY=[your-api-key]
ELASTICSEARCH_NODE=http://localhost:9200
```

## Usage

### Working with Jupyter Notebooks

1. Open VS Code
2. Open any `.ipynb` file from the `notebooks/` directory
3. Click on the kernel selector in the top right corner
4. Select "Deno" as your kernel
5. Start coding!

The notebooks provide detailed examples of:

- Connecting to Elasticsearch
- Performing basic search queries
- Data analysis with Elasticsearch
- Visualization and reporting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Deno Kernel Not Found**

   - Ensure Deno is in your PATH
   - Try reinstalling the Deno kernel
   - Check VS Code Jupyter extension settings

2. **Elasticsearch Connection Issues**
   - Verify Elasticsearch is running
   - Check the connection settings in your notebooks
   - Ensure proper permissions are set
